NotificationHandler is a neat Swift notification operations wrapper. With NotificationHandler, it's super easy to handle notifications with neat API. What's more, remove obersers is also properly handled.

Fetures include:

* Modern and clear method signature
* Implicit observer removal on controller dealloc.


## Usage

```
// with closure
self.notificationHandler.observe(notificationName) { (notification) -> Void in
    // do something...
}

// or with selector

self.notificaqtionHandler.observe(notificationName, selector: "SayHi")

```

This is the complete example. The removal of observer will be done when controller is deallocated.
